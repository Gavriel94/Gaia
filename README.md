An evolution in knowledge sharing and community.

A social media website designed to allow communities to arise through topics.
Users can create topics, which act as threads, allowing others to find specific information or have discussions with like-minded people.

Gaia uses a combination of three deep learning models in order to moderate every post.

Users are anonymous by default as [Cardano](https://cardano.org) wallets are used to create an account. 

A social media website built using React and Tailwind, with Django as the backend.
